#+TITLE: My configuration

Initially, this just contains my doom emacs configuration. But after learning
about [[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs/tree/develop/modules/config/literate][literate configs]], I feel it is a good way to improve readability. So I
decided to use it for all my dotfiles. The [[file:other/][other]] directory contains (will
contain) every =rc= file I changes. It has been separated with [[file:config.org][doom emacs configs]]
since reloading them everytime I modify my emacs configs would be too slow.
